<h2>Rent My EV Vision</h2>
<p> As new electric vehicles are being announced on the market, everyone wants to take a test ride. Most of us only dream about going zero to sixty in less than 6 seconds due to the high cost of electric vehicles. <br><br>
    That is why we at Rent My EV are so interested in helping you test our vehicles to determine whether or not they will make a good fit in your everyday life. Just as it can be difficult to purchase clothes online without trying them on, we believe it can also be daunting to buy an elctric vehicle without knowing how it really feels to drive one. <br><br>
    We also believe the future quality of life depends in part on the reduction of emissions and clean air. At Rent My EV, we are determined to do our part, however small, to take care of our Earth. Check out Rent My EV today to see if an EV is the right fit for you.

<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p> Our story inevitably began behind the wheel of a car. It was a brand new 2021 Nissan Pathfinder. Taylor took Steven for a spin around the block to show off his new ride.
  They rounded the corner when the car suddenly made some sad sputtering sounds and came to a stop. <br>
  Taylor matched the steam coming from the hood of the car with his own. In that moment of frustration and exasperation, we asked eachother some important questions.<br>
  "Why do we spend so much money on possessions that cause us so many problems, and in such little time?" "Is there a better way?" It was in that moment of darkness when the lights turned on and Rent My EV was born.
